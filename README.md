Doctors Availability Prediction
Project Overview
Project Title: Doctors Availability Prediction
Hospital Data Source: Apollo Hospitals
Aim:
The main aim of this project is to predict the availability of doctors based on their location. We collected data from the Apollo Hospitals website using web scraping techniques. The dataset includes information about doctors, such as their name, specialty, education, registration number, experience, and location.

Data Collection
Source:
The data was collected from the Apollo Hospitals website: Apollo Hospitals - Book Doctor Appointment

Data Columns:
The dataset comprises the following columns:

Doctor Name
Speciality
Education
Registration No.
Experience
Location
Data Analysis
Objective:
The primary objective is to analyze the dataset and predict the availability of doctors at different locations based on their specialties.

Approach:
We utilized web scraping techniques to extract data from the Apollo Hospitals website. The collected data was then analyzed using clustering models to identify patterns and group doctors based on their locations and specialties.

Models Used
1) K-means Clustering:
K-means clustering was applied to group doctors into clusters based on their features. This model helps identify locations where doctors with similar characteristics are available.

2) K-Modes Clustering:
K-Modes clustering was employed to cluster doctors based on categorical features. This model is effective for clustering data with categorical variables and helps discover patterns in doctor availability.

Model Comparison
Evaluation Criteria:
The models were evaluated based on their ability to effectively cluster doctors and predict availability.

Results:
After careful evaluation, the K-means clustering model demonstrated superior performance in identifying clusters of doctors based on location and specialty.

Conclusion
Best Model:
The K-means clustering model emerged as the best-fit model for predicting the availability of doctors. It effectively grouped doctors into clusters based on their features, providing valuable insights into doctor distribution across different locations.

Future Steps:
Future steps may involve refining the model, incorporating additional features, and considering other machine learning techniques for further improvement.
